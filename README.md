# Gary's Pawn Daily Transaction Application
## Sales Transaction program for Garys Pawn and Gun / MSU Senior Project 22'
- GUI application for modern operating system that takes an initial on hand cash amount, and compares with the total cash on hand at the end of the day.
- Takes Sale amount and adds total per transaction.
- Takes Pawn amount (deduction or addition) and adds to total per transaction.
- Takes Purchase amount and deducts from total per transaction.
- Generates PDF report at the end of the day with per transaction detail.

# Todo:
- Clean up formatting so columns align
- Need a way to save cash on hand for each day + record numbers (store by date?) in a text file?
- Current date should be displayed upon running the program.
- On tab, the total register sales should continuously +=.
  - Can we update amounts on tab hit, just like the original program?
- Beginning cash on hand? Where does this come from?
- Need to style an .txt or .csv file that can be generated at the end of the day with per transaction break down.
- Need to put labels in order of tab priority (check videos).
